<h2>About Me</h2>

<p> Hi. I am a first-year graduate student in the M.S. program for Scientific and Technical Communication at the University of Minnesota. I currently work as a veterinary technician at the University of Minnesota's Veterinary Medical Center within their small animal hospital. I also live in the Como neighborhood of Saint Paul, MN, so I'd say I know the area pretty well.  </p>


<h2>Education</h2>

<p>B.A. in English Literature with a minor in Technical Communication.</p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Minnesota <em><i>magna cum laude</i></em> in 2012. I took courses such as "Intro to Editing," "Editing, Critique, & Style," "Public Writing," "Scientific & Technical Presentations" and "Technical & Professional Writing."  </p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>My interests include usability studies and the user experience, literacy and education, and structured authoring. On a personal note, I enjoy spending time with my fiance and our two German Shepherds. We frequently take walks around Como Lake and enjoy our yearly trip up to the North Shore. </p>
